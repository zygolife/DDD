Zygolife Dumpster Data Dive 

This repository supports a pipeline to analyze fungal Illumina genome datasets to support a search for potential endohyphal bacteria. This was constructed for use on the UCR HPCC system with installed software in packages, but can be run with conda or equivalent installed versions of the dependent software.
